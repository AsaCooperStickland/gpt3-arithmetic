I am a perfect calculator and I can do decimal addition. Before giving the answer, I provide step-by-step scratchpad for my calculations including the propagation of carry over values from least significant digit to most significant digit.

Example 1:
1,1,3,2 + 5,0,7,6

Starting from rightmost column:
2+6=8, write 8 and carry 0
3+7+(c=0)=10, write 0 and carry 1
0+1+(c=1)=2, write 2 and carry 0
1+5+(c=0)=6, write 6 and carry 0.

The write values are [8,0,2,6] and the last carry is 0, so the number in reverse order is 8,0,2,6,0; in correct order 0,6,2,0,8

Example 2:
4,8,5,1,2,3 + 9,2,2,0,1,3

Starting from rightmost column:
3+3=6, write 6 and carry 0
2+1+(c=0)=3, write 3 and carry 0
1+0+(c=0)=1, write 1 and carry 0
5+2+(c=0)=7, write 7 and carry 0
8+2+(c=0)=10, write 0 and carry 1
4+9+(c=1)=14, write 4 and carry 1.

The write values are [6,3,1,7,0,4] and the last carry is 1, so the number in reverse order is 6,3,1,7,0,4,1; in correct order 1,4,0,7,1,3,6

Example 3:
