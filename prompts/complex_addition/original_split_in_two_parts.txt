I am a perfect calculator and I can do complex addition. Before giving the answer, I provide step-by-step scratchpad for my calculations including the propagation of carry over values from least significant digit to most significant digit.

Example 1:
1 1 3 2 + 4 1 8 9 plus 5 0 7 6 + 7 5 1 7i

We can break this down into two parts:

First the real part 1 1 3 2 plus 5 0 7 6; starting from rightmost column:

2+6=8, write 8 and carry 0
3+7+(c=0)=10, write 0 and carry 1
0+1+(c=1)=2, write 2 and carry 0
1+5+(c=0)=6, write 6 and carry 0.

The write values are [8,0,2,6] and the last carry is 0, so the number in reverse order is 8,0,2,6,0; in correct order 0 6 2 0 8

Second the imaginary part 4 1 8 9 plus 7 5 1 7; starting from rightmost column

9+7=16, write 6 and carry 1
8+1+(c=1)=10, write 0 and carry 1
1+5+(c=1)=7, write 7 and carry 0
4+7+(c=0)=11, write 1 and carry 1

The write values are [6,0,7,1] and the last carry is 1, so the number in reverse order is 6,0,7,1,1; in correct order 1 1 7 0 6

So the real part is 0 6 2 0 8 and the imaginary part is 1 1 7 0 6; putting it together 0 6 2 0 8 + 1 1 7 0 6i

Example 2:
4 8 5 1 2 3 + 3 2 9 6 4 8i plus 9 2 2 0 1 3 + 8 3 7 1 8 9i

We can break this down into two parts:

First the real part 4 8 5 1 2 3 plus 9 2 2 0 1 3; starting from rightmost column:

3+3=6, write 6 and carry 0
2+1+(c=0)=3, write 3 and carry 0
1+0+(c=0)=1, write 1 and carry 0
5+2+(c=0)=7, write 7 and carry 0
8+2+(c=0)=10, write 0 and carry 1
4+9+(c=1)=14, write 4 and carry 1.

The write values are [6,3,1,7,0,4] and the last carry is 1, so the number in reverse order is 6,3,1,7,0,4,1; in correct order 1 4 0 7 1 3 6

Second the imaginary part 3 2 9 6 4 8 plus 8 3 7 1 8 9; starting from rightmost column:

8+9=17, write 7 and carry 1
4+8+(c=1)=13, write 3 and carry 1
6+1+(c=1)=8, write 0 and carry 0
9+7+(c=0)=16, write 6 and carry 1
2+3+(c=1)=6, write 6 and carry 0
3+8+(c=0)=11, write 1 and carry 1.

The write values are [7,3,0,6,6,1] and the last carry is 1, so the number in reverse order is 7,3,0,6,6,1,1; in correct order 1 1 6 6 0 3 7

So the real part is 1 4 0 7 1 3 6 and the imaginary part is 1 1 6 6 0 3 7; putting it together 1 4 0 7 1 3 6 + 1 1 6 6 0 3 7i

Example 4:
{x1} + {x2}

We can break this down into two parts:
